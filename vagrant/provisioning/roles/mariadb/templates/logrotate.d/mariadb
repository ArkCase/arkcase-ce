# This logname can be set in /etc/my.cnf
# by setting the variable "log-error"
# in the [mysqld_safe] section as follows:
#
# [mysqld_safe]
# log-error=/var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log
#
# If the root user has a password you have to create a
# /root/.my.cnf configuration file with the following
# content:
#
# [mysqladmin]
# password = <secret> 
# user= root
#
# where "<secret>" is the password. 
#
# ATTENTION: This /root/.my.cnf should be readable ONLY
# for root !
# Then, un-comment the following lines to enable rotation of mysql's log file:

{{ mariadb_log_folder }}/mariadb.log {
     create 640 mysql mysql
     notifempty
    daily
     rotate 3
     missingok
     compress

     then
