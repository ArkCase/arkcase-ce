# This file allows to restrict SSL behavior in Mule. If the file doesn't exist or a property is not defined,
# default values of the current security provider will be used.

# Protocols that will be enabled in SSL. If this property is set, SSL sockets will only use protocols
# that are provided in this list and supported by the current security provider.

# in the ArkCase CE VM, the httpd server is configured with a
# higher (read: more restrictive) set of encryption ciphers.
# Mule uses its own http client which does not include any
# compatible ciphers out-of-the-box.  So we have to tell Mule
# to use the below cipher.
