  * This setting allows the deployment to specify where to find the 
  * database-specific hibernate configuration. The samples supplied
  * include the following:
  * 
  * system/hibernate/hsql.hibernate.cfg.xml
  * system/hibernate/mysql5.hibernate.cfg.xml
  * system/hibernate/postgresql.hibernate.cfg.xml
  * system/hibernate/oracle10g.hibernate.cfg.xml

  * managed should be set to true if running the BI Platform
  * in a managed environment (like JBoss, Orion, etc). In this configuration,
  * you should specify another location for the hibernate.cfg.xml (see below)
  * instead of simply using the default one provided. This setting essentially
  * tells the HibernateUtil class to use JNDI to locate the factory class for
  * getting sessions. This allows the platform to use Hibernate across boundaries
  * in message beans (for example).
